# Basic Java Documentation

## Repository Description

This repository contains basic documentation about the Java programming language. It is designed to help beginners understand fundamental Java concepts, including the structure of a program, classes, attributes, and methods.

## Instructions

### Download Necessary Tools

To work with Java, you need to install the following tools on your computer:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The JDK is a development environment necessary to compile and run Java applications. You can download the latest version of the JDK from Oracle's official website: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Apache Maven (Optional)**: If you plan to manage dependencies and perform automatic builds, you can install Apache Maven. Download it from the official site: [Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Use a Preferred IDE

To edit and run your Java code, it is recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here are some popular options:

1. **IntelliJ IDEA**: A powerful and very popular IDE for Java development. You can download the free Community version: [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. **Eclipse**: Another widely used IDE for Java, with many features and plugins. Download it from here: [Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

3. **NetBeans**: An open-source IDE that supports several programming languages, including Java. Download it from here: [Download NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

### Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Install the JDK**: Follow the installer instructions to install the JDK on your system. Make sure to configure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and add the JDK's `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

2. **Configure the IDE**: Once you have installed the JDK, open your preferred IDE and configure it to use the installed JDK. Most IDEs have setup wizards that will guide you through the process.

3. **Create a New Project**: Use your IDE to create a new Java project. This will automatically set up the necessary folder and file structure to start writing and running Java code.
