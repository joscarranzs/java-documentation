# Data types in Java

## Numeric data types
Java has several numeric data types to handle different ranges of values. Here are the types with definitions and examples:

### short
A 16-bit integer type. It can store values from −32,768 to 32,767.
Example:
```java
short number = 150;
```

### byte
An 8-bit integer type. It can store values from −128 to 127.
Example:
```java
byte smallNumber = 20;
```

### int
A 32-bit integer type. It can store values from −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
Example:
```java
int count = 1000;
```

### long
A 64-bit integer type. It can store values from −92,233,720,368,547,758,08 to 92,233,720,368,547,758,07.
Example:
```java
long largeNumber = 100000L;
```

### float
A 32-bit floating-point type. It is used for fractional numbers, with up to 7 decimal digits of precision.
Example:
```java
float price = 19.99f;
```

### double
A 64-bit floating-point type. It is used for fractional numbers, with up to 15 decimal digits of precision.
Example:
```java
double distance = 12345.6789;
```

## Character data types
Character data types are used to store single characters. In Java, the primary type is:

### char
A 16-bit type that stores a single character or Unicode value.
Example:
```java
char letter = 'A';
```

---

## Boolean data types
Boolean data types represent true or false values.

### boolean
A type that holds one of two possible values: `true` or `false`.
Example:
```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```
